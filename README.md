# Portfolio Description

A portfolio is a collection of representative work.   My portfolio is a set of R notebooks  (R markdown documents and the associated html document resulting from preview.)


A notebook is a short analysis of a problem, illustrating a particular skill that I have learned in this class.


Some example skills that I have demonstrated:

Visualizing data using ggplot2 (scatterplot, histogram, barchart, lineplot).
Manipulate data (demonstrate dplyr verbs   filter, summarise, join, select, rename, slice).
Data loading and tidying and cleaning (to include    pivot-wider   and pivot-longer).
Data science process (major steps).
